REST API - representational State Transfer - is a software architecture that impose
condition of API should work.

      REST was initially created to manage communication on complex network.

      Uniform interface - a fundamental design of RESTful webservices
      imposes four architectural constraints:
      - Requests should identify resources.
      - by sending metadata, Clients have enough information in the resource representation to modify or delete the resource
      - by sending self-descriptive messages that contain metadata, Clients receive information about how to process the representation further.
      -  by sending hyperlinks in the representation, Clients receive information about all other related resources they need to complete a task.

      -Statelessness - server does not store any client contenxt
        o benefit: less memory usage.
        
      -Layered system - be the middleman between client and server, provide sercurity or speed up the request.
        o benefit: more secure and faster.

      -cacheability - store response in the cache, so next time the client can get the response, no need to request the server again.
        o benefit: faster.
 
RESTful API - an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.

      the basic function of RESTful API is same as browsing the web.

      the client contact the server by using the API when it requires resources.

      These are the general steps for any REST API call:
      - client follows the API documentation to format to send request to server.
      - server authenticates the client and confirm the client has permission to make request.
      - server receives the request and processes it internally.
      - server return response to client, info contain:  
          1: wheather the request was successful?
          2: info that client requested.
