4 Patterns:
1:Reflection --> feed LLM a version 1 code, and take the feedback, make it better and better, eg: version-x code.
2:Tools use  
3:Planning -->  
    eg: Request: Please generate an image where a girl is reading a book, 
    and her pose is the same as the boy in the image example.jpg, 
    then please describe the new image with your voice.

    input: a boy.jpg file.

    process:
    1: Pose determination (openpose model)
    2: Pose to Img (goole/vit model)
    3: img to txt (bit-gpt2 model)
    4: text to speech (fast speech model)


4:Multi- Agent collaboration
    just like different model have its own specific best skill
    for example, 'A' model is good at writing, 'B' model is good at planning, 'C' model is good at img analysis.
    then, the whole task will be completed by this 3 models.
