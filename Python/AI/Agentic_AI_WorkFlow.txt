Agentic Ai Work flow: 
a process where a LLM based app works through mutiples steps to complete a task

Degree of Autonomous
less autonomous: all steps predetermined, all tools are hardcoded
high autonomous: AI agent makes a lots of decisions, create new functions.

Benefit of using Agentic work flow
1: Faster than human, because it can parallelization.
2: Much better performance
3: can add or update tools, and swap models

Agentic AI application senario:
1: Invoice processing workflow
requirement: need LLM to help us to look at the pdf and update the database.
process
1.1: input : the invoice bill, call PDF to text converter API
1.2: then LLM will use another tools to update the database.

2:Responding customer emails and update database
requirement: need LLM to through emails to update customer data.
2.1: input: email, LLM verify and extract key infomation.
2.2: LLM use tools to order database query.
2.3: LLM then try to draft the response and request review the database by using request and review tools.
2.4: send to customer after approved.

Decomposite AI work flow:
eg: writing an eassy
in human perspective
step 1: write an essay outline on topic X (LLM)
step 2: search Web (LLM + search engine)
step 3: write the essay(LLM) (maybe we will feel the essay not good and write again.)
So in step 3: write the first draft of the essay (LLM)
step 4: consider what parts need revision
step 5: Revise your draft
