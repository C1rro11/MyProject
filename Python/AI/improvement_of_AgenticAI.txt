Non-LLM components (web search, text retrieval for RAG, code execution, trained ML model, eg recognizing photo.)
1: tune hyperparameters of components
    - web search: number of results, date range.
    - RAG: change similar threshold, chunk size.
    - ML model: Detection threshold.

2: replace components
    -try different web search engine, RAG provider, etc.

LLM components:

1: improve prompt (add explicit instructions.)
2: try new model / try multi-model / use eval to pick the best
3: split up the step - decompose the task
4: fine-tune model - fine tune internal data to improve performance
