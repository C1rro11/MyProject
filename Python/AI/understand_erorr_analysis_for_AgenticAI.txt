observed problem: missing key point something

think about the workflow of the LLM will do.

                user query --> LLM and use tool? --> web search tool --> LLM tools(pdf to text? web fetch?) --> web fetch --> LLM write essay.

possible cause:              |bad research terms?| low quality result?  |        poor selection of result?    | 


in order to understand what components affect, we can tracking the traces of the LLM.

trace meaning : the result of the components.

forexample: first steps of LLM output the searching results of the topics, then next step is the output of the overall url ,etc.
see which part of the result getting wrong.

then, create a spreadsheet to count up the error are (write down some word to describe).

then, calculate the errors percentage for each components.
eg: the reason making LLM output unstasifactory result because of
    search item: 5%, search result:45%, picking 5 best resources: 5%, etc.

End-to-end error analysis and improvement are expensive. So, instead of doing a 
whole end-to-end eror analysis or improvement in a whole system. we can do
components-levels error analysis or improvement.

eg: analysis the search engine, pdf-to-text tools, etc.
