gives code X to LLM --> LLM write first draft --> output: v1 code --> execute
--> feedback (error) --> input: output code, feedback msg/error (give LLM again) -->
LLM write draft again --> ... -> version x code.

Understand what is Zero, one, and few-prompting.
1: Zero prompting: no example feed to LLMs.
2: one prompting : 1 example feed to LLMs.
3: few prompting : few example feed to LLMs.

direct generation also called zero prompting.
eg: writing an eassy, tell LLMs to create a calculation formula without giving example.

Why not just direct generation?
interation reflection can make performance better than zero prompting.

can you rewarding reflection to make AI being the judge to adjust the performance.

performance comparison
agentic AI with external feedback > Agentic AI with reflection > zero prompting Agentic AI.


agentic AI with external feedback:
eg: Challenge: LLM won't follow output length guideline example: essay over the word limit
    source feedback: using word count tools to give fact to improve the LLM output.
