What is tools?
it is let LLM can be used for doing some action for you.

eg: ask LLM what time is it now?
without tools: LLM -> sorry i don't have to right to access the current time.



now we define the function get_current_time():

from datetime import datetime
def get_current_time():
    """return the current time as string"""

    return datetime.now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")


with get_current_time() Tools --> now the time is XX:XX:XX


Also LLM can design to use the tools or not.

eg: asking the menu of LLM , then LLM might dont use the tool.



There are other example of LLM using tools:

1: asking: can you help me to find a italian restaurant?

LLM --> web_search(query="italian restaurant").

2: show me the inventory of sunglasses.

LLM --> query_database(tables="inventory", product="sunglasses").
